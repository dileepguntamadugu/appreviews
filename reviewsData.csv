2021-08-28T20:24:48-07:00,5,Very solid GSM for the sub $20 market,Great on the nose and the pallet. A real richness to this wine consistent with bottles double the price. An absolute cracker at $16 as often on sale at Uncle Dan’s - do yourself a favour and get around Claymore’s You will never walk alone GSM! Jay Arrold Kangaroo Point BNE
